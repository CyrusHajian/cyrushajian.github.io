My passions outside of science and academia.

Although, science has a beautiful way of bleeding into everything.

## Learning
I'm a curious person, and find joy in putting effort into learning or understanding the world. I enjoy approaching ideas from various angles, and discussing/building ideas and concepts with others. 

## Cooking
I have been cooking since I was very young, and it has become one of my most rewarding hobbies. Cooking has taught me to be methodical and patient, and to learn effectively from mistakes through iteration and practice. It has also given me a deep appreciation for other cultures and the ways food reflects history, tradition, and community.

I enjoy experimenting with ingredients, learning new recipes, and teaching others what I learn along the way. I regularly cook for  family and friends and am comfortable preparing a wide range of dishes across many cuisines, including Japanese, Italian, Mediterranean, Filipino, Chinese, Caribbean, Mexican, and Caribbean, among many more. 

I love iterating a recipe until it suits the taste of myself, or whomever I'm serving it to. 

## Fishing

      Fishing has always been one of my favorite ways to experience nature. I am an experienced surf, lake, and river fisherman. I find the strategy for fishing fascinating, changing baits to reflect the target species' prey, surveying surroundings to find places fish will likely be, and the overall idea of using a hidden line attached to bait with the goal of enticing a predator into attacking it... (maybe I'm just weird). Anyways, fishing tends to take me to some beautiful places.

      Aside from the general beauty of nature, I find plants and animals fascinating.
      Beautiful places tend to be remote, and I love journeying to these places, often
      with friends. The forests and beaches of the Pacific Northwest have my heart.

## Photography
I'm not much of a photographer, but there are some things I see with my eyes that I would like to look at later. Check out some of my photos in /adventures/.
