My passions in the realm of science and academia.

## Mentorship
I enjoy being able to help people. If I'm in a position to help someone, I will. 

Through programs such as the PUENTE Project, the Avanzando Initiative, the Stanford Community College Outreach Program, and others I would meet with community college students in order to provide anything I could that would be able to help them. Whether that be in the form of answering their questions, sharing insights about my journey, discussing strategies for securing extracurricular opportunities, I am always happy to help.

At Stanford, I served as a Stanford Community College Advisory Chair, offering my perspective as a transfer student from a community college to guide outreach strategy. I personally mentored a number of underprivileged community college students, specifically regarding achieving success in finding extracurricular opportunities, transferring to their target school, and generally finding success in academia. 

I have a number of students I regularly maintain contact with. It's always a great moment hearing about one of them securing an opportunity or reaching one of their goals.

If you feel that I may be able to help you in some way, or if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to email me.

## Education and Science Advocacy

As someone who found a love for education later in life, reducing obstacles in accessing it is profoundly important to me. 

In that vein, I have communicated the importance of education for low income community college students to federal and state lawmakers at public hearings in attempts to stand against policy that would further debilitate the ability for people to access formal education.
